            <p>🎼 Professor Cohen later proved to be the most helpful mentor for my degree. That’s why I insist: even if the theatre has a better union, a better platform such as Composer Now, or even if you bring Obama in, I will neither dress differently nor speak differently for the so-called “better audiences.”</p>
            <p>🎭 My Plan X is to embrace reverse portraiture—it doesn’t matter how many people laugh at me. Let’s badmouth Beethoven all the way to Morton Feldman, and then highlight Professor Shane and Professor Cohen.</p>
            <p>😅 I really dislike what I call “shame avant-garde,” but since shame is a strong word, I’ve replaced it with “avant trends-garde.” However, I hope you become a genuine avant-garde artist or the one you aspire to be. Even if not like my favorite, Stockhausen, at least be like Professor Cohen. 🙂 Then, 🌟 as an avant trad, I wish you good luck! 🙂 </p>
