# ParallelThx

**ParallelThx** is a digital e-card designed to express gratitude to Hussam's parallel ex-evil twin😔, now seen as an angel too thanks to Hussam's intangible influence. This project serves as a heartfelt and creative token of appreciation. A love and hate relationship that saved me 2005$.

## 😔**An early morning email:**
I feel awful right now. You’re almost graduating, and I’ve given you a hard time for 3/4 of your BC Theatre career. :< I made you an E-card, and it's written based on last year's Plan A, B, and C, with a bonus Plan X. It’s a love-and-hate card. Now that I think about it, it was a selfish Plan A and B, even if I bought you a card last year and let you read it in full “indeterminacy mode” 💀. Then I messed up, and everyone started being mean. I held grudges against you, but now it feels so dramatic, lol.

About the "music speaks for itself" thing: not only you but a lot of people say that—in museums, in my other classes, elsewhere. I know you had good intentions back then, but by now, you see the point: all those theatre people, including Prof DXX, have proven time and time again that "music is definitely not universal, and it definitely won’t speak to everyone." People just put stickers on it. I still like her though and learned a lot from her, even two years ago when I was in my dreamy phase. Two years ago, I emailed her when her pet passed away; now she has a cat, and I see how well she moved on from history. Lol.

I’m so sick of new music stuff now, and I’m planning to go avant-trad mode 💀. Anyway, I didn’t listen to her on Monday, so I spent that time making this E-card and designing stuff. Even if I wanted to argue, I didn’t have time. I’ll just focus on women in art history and avoid discussions like I did years ago.

I didn’t attend the new music recording session, so now even Prof GXX is holding grudges against me. Long story short, it’s been a big disappointment this semester. The only one who helped me was Prof Cohen, and Prof Polina was very nice. I’m worried something similar will happen like last year, so I begged Prof Cohen for permission to give everyone a big break. Please help me thank Prof Cohen for that.

About the card and the $2005 price tag… I had a dream about you at the beginning of the semester. You were a very friendly guy in my dream. Then I woke up and missed my Thor fusion and rage-quit this game called Raid Shadow Legend. I thought, “Damn, this guy still can’t be trusted.” 😒 But then I realized, by quitting that game, I saved at least $2000 in credit card disasters and could focus on data science and tech courses.

I had a similar parallel problem with my tech courses too—so many arrogant and mean people. Almost everything felt like last year, so my weird mind started associating these events with weird references. Then I got this super nice TA called Hussam. Not only did my Plan A work, but I also came up with plans A to Z, and ideas kept blooming. I saw him as the parallel version of you from that prophesy dream.

So, now I see you as an angel too. That’s why I thought, “Damn, this guy actually saved me $2005 (the $2000 plus the $5 card if I’d bought you one last year and written down Plan A, B, C).” It worked locally, but not on my cheap GitHub repo. The song won’t auto-play on the GitHub page—only on my app. But you need to click the song at the top left.

The song is a friendly, satirical tune called "Cover Your Ears, Close Your Eyes, and Let the Silence Speak and Dance for Itself." The first part is an intro circus-like piano from last year, then a merry-go-round piano piece from the Winter C forum. I added a random off-tune lyric with Synthesizer V voice and typed the syllabus one by one with accents—lol—but it was fun to make 😊.

Let’s make this more woke than 4:33. After hearing the song, play as your own musician for a year 💀. Anyway, I’ll stop here—I haven’t slept, it’s 7:42 am. I’ve had three sleepless nights due to heavy workloads. Hussam said I’m not the worst in the data track, and he was very kind, even though our group was seriously disorganized, and we finished everything at the last minute.

This feels so parallel. I know I’m probably the worst person in your experience right now, but I’ll make up for it before you graduate. 😭 When you become a great musician, I hope you meet someone worse than me, so I can be the second worst, lol… Sorry, and good luck with your concert! Good night 😴
