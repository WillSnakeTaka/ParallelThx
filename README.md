# ParallelThx

**ParallelThx** is a digital e-card designed to express gratitude to Hussam's parallel ex-evil twinðŸ˜”, now seen as an angel too thanks to Hussam's intangible influence. This project serves as a heartfelt and creative token of appreciation. A love and hate relationship that saved me 2005$.
